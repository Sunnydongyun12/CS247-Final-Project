The service is great (maybe even borderline nagging but at least you get attention), the desserts are excellent and the coffee is so very good...

We were seated next to a couple whose kitchen was being renovated and we agreed since we're all foodies who eat out a lot - that this wasn't a place we'd return to.

The food is just OKAY, and it's almost not worth going unless you're getting the pialla, which is the only dish that's really good.

The guac is fresh, yet lacking flavor, we like to add our fresh salsa into it.

The new menu has a few creative items,they were smart enough to keep some of the old favorites (but they raised the prices), the staff is friendly most of the time, but I must agree with the person that wrote about their favorite words: No, can't, sorry..., boy, they won't bend the rules for anyone.

If you like seafood and/or Greek food you will love this place though it is not limited to just these things.

" The menu includes pub fare--burgers, steaks and shepherds pie--and even a portabella lasagna for those black sheep known as "vegetarians.

Creamy appetizers--taramasalata, eggplant salad, and Greek yogurt (with cuccumber, dill, and garlic) taste excellent when on warm pitas.
